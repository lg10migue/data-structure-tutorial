## Overview of Data Structures

Data structures are a fundamental aspect of computer science. They are specialized formats for organizing, processing, storing, and retrieving data. Each structure is designed to organize data to suit specific purposes so that various operations can be performed efficiently. Understanding these structures is essential for writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.

## How to Use This Tutorial

This tutorial is structured into modules, each focusing on a particular data structure. Navigate through the modules to build upon your knowledge progressively. You're encouraged to code along and solve the given problems at the end of each module to solidify your understanding.

## Modules

Start your learning journey with the following modules:

-   [Queues](data-structures/01-queue.md)
-   [Linked Lists](data-structures/02-linked-list.md)
-   [Trees](data-structures/03-tree.md)

Remember to attempt the problem at the end of each module before checking the solution. This approach will ensure a stronger grasp of data structures and their practical applications. Good luck, and happy coding!
